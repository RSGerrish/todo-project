To Do List For Practice with SOLID Principles

[RSG 04/22/2022]
Happy with this project so far but I am currently hung up on local storage.

If/when I revisit this project I believe I should rethink the class/constructor(s) and perhaps condence everything down to one class. Then I can tackle the local storage a bit easier. I think I can easily add a 'remove' button for each project and task however I am going to move on from this project for now as to not get too burnt out on it.
